Max line width is 26 character for most of the text
The width limit for the text in the Menu folder is 25

Every line ends with a terminator
The terminator is any short with the highest bit set
In vanilla, the terminators indicate the size of the line
however, all of them do the exact same thing, there is
no difference. Use whatever you want

The file NPC/663.txt contains some dev text in vanilla
This text actually appears in the game, it's used by
Yoshirin and Micchi when they trade you the
Moe-p figurine for the Moe-p sticker
Since there's no trace of the original dialogue
that I could find, I just had to make it up

There are some files that only contain "j[0xea00]"
These files are ignored by the parser script
