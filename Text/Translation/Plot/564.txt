Shin-chan and Toppema[0x8011]
head back to Henderland.[0x8011]
They must take the cards[0x8011]
to the crystal core in[0x8011]
the castle, which is the[0x8011]
witches' source of power.[0x8011]
This is the only way to[0x8011]
stop Makao and Joma,[0x8011]
the fate of the world is[0x8011]
on Shin-chan's hands![0x8011]
